## IMPORTANT NOTES!!
I will be honest... this has become fairly complicated but the architecture is pretty clean and expandible. The tests are located within their respective subdomains of the game: Board.Tests, Playables.tests, and GameEngine.Tests. I know this seems like a hastle, but I've made it incredibly easy to follow the tests... you can read it like a book! If you have any questions, I'd be happy to show you how the (domain-driven) architecture flows.
